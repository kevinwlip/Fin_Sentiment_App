Have app contents on GitHub.

Connect to AWS EC2 Instance.

In EC2 command line:

```
$ sudo su
$ yum update
$ yum install git
$ yum install python3-pip
```

Get GitHub link to repo.
```
$ git clone [GitHub repo link]
$ cd [repo]
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If issue with requests library try the following

`$ python3 -m pip install --ignore-installed streamlit`

Run App

`$ python3 -m streamlit run app.py`

Keep app running, even if you close the EC2 instance window/terminal

`$ nohup python3 -m streamlit run app.py`

Look for process ID and kill the app, to prevent AWS charges
```
$ sudo su
$ ps -ef
$ kill [PID]
```
